## Deck of Cards and Poker Hand Evaluation

This is a Python program that simulates a deck of cards and evaluates poker hands for players. It utilizes algorithms like the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible hand in a poker game.

### Key Features

- **`Card` Class**: Represents a card from the deck with a value and a suit. It can be showing or hidden.
- **`Deck` Class**: Simulates a deck of cards, with methods to create a new deck, shuffle it, and deal card hands.
- **`evaluate_hand` Function**: Evaluates a player's hand based on the cards they have in hand and the community cards (the flop).
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Used to obtain the best possible hand among multiple players' hands.
